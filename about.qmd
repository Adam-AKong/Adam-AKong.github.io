# About Me!

I'm all about those projects! But most importantly I care about the quality of those projects.

Coming into college I did not know what I was coming in to. I switched into Statistics in the beginning of my second year from another major called Industrial Technology and Packaging (ITP).

I was born in Pasadena CA, in 2003. I'm currently 20 looking to enjoy my life at Cal Poly. Even when I switched out of ITP to Statistics, I've kept in touch with a lot of my friends from my previous majors and I love volunteering for all the clubs I'm involved with!
