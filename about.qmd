I'm all about those projects! But most importantly I care about the quality of those projects.

Coming into college I did not know what I was coming in to. I switched into Statistics in the beginning of my second year from another major called Industrial Technology and Packaging (ITP).

I was born in Pasadena CA, in 2003. I'm currently 20 looking to enjoy my life at Cal Poly. Even when I switched out of ITP to Statistics, I've kept in touch with a lot of my friends from my previous majors and I love volunteering for all the clubs I'm involved with!

I hope to become more involved with the Cal Poly Stats club and all my culture clubs I am involved with. Currently I am in a lot of involvements such as Cal Poly Stats Club, Chinese Student Association (CSA), Korean American Student Association (KASA), Pilipino Cultural Exchange (PCE), Nikkei Student Union (NSU), EPIC, Asian American Christian Fellowship (AACF), and possibly more!

I hope to expand this website by beginning with my most recent projects to my least relevant projects from top to bottom on the projects tab. Hopefully it isn't too long for anyone to read.
